# How It Works  

## Tokenizing a Truck  
- Each truck is legally wrapped in an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)  
- An ERC-20 token represents fractional ownership in the poo    

## Capital Pooling  
- Investors stake USDC to co-purchase trucks  
- Pools diversify exposure across multiple vehicles    

## Deployment 
- Trucks are leased to verified logistics firms (Trucki.co)
- Revenue is earned per trip/month based on real operations  

## Yield Distribution  
- Revenue → Stablecoin → Payout to LPs (monthly)
- AudaCity charges a 15% performance fee on net profit  

# Token Model
## Pool Token ($AUDx)
- Represents fractional ownership in a specific truck pool
- Earns real-time or monthly yield from logistics profits
- Can be staked, traded, used as DeFi collateral

## Governance Token ($AUDA — coming soon)
- Future utility: governance, fee structure proposals, insurance oversight
- Path to decentralization of protocol economics

# Smart Contract Stack
- Truck Registry Contract: Tracks ownership, assignment to pools
- Revenue Splitter Contract: Distributes stablecoin income to token holders
- Access Control / Whitelisting: Ensures compliant onboarding
- Oracle Feed Integration: Syncs operational data from logistics APIs
- SPV-Mapped Logic Layer: Tied to real-world asset legal infrastructure
