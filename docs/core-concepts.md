# Protocol Principles & Risk Framework

Our work is guided by a few core beliefs:
- Real yield should come from real activity. Logistics moves economies — it can move capital too  
- Access is a right, not a luxury. The small operators who power emerging markets deserve better financing.
- Transparency builds trust. Onchain data, real-time GPS, verified revenue. Always visible.
- DeFi deserves better assets. Not just tokens that trade. Assets that earn.  


# Underwriting & Risk Framework
AudaCity conducts careful vetting of every truck pool and operating partner. Our underwriting process includes:

## Operator Qualification
- Identity verification (KYC)
- Fleet management experience
- Delivery SLA performance (>90%)
- Historical earning data

## Truck Pool Criteria
- Asset type: Class 7–8 commercial freight trucks
- GPS tracking and maintenance enabled
- Revenue projection based on route, load type, and partner demand

## Risk Evaluation Metrics
- Revenue per km & per delivery
- Truck downtime rate
- Fuel, maintenance, insurance burden
- Payment terms & partner solvency

## Risk Mitigation Tools
- Pooling diversification (no single-truck pools)
- SLAs with recourse clauses
- Revenue escrow buffers
- Token holder dashboard with real-time metrics
This framework ensures we protect investor capital while unlocking real access for logistics firms.

All contracts will undergo external audits and bug bounty programs prior to mainnet launch.
