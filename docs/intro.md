## What is AudaCity?  

AudaCity is a real-world asset (RWA) protocol that tokenizes commercial trucks into fractional, yield-bearing tokens. Investors buy into pooled truck ownership, while logistics partners lease and operate the trucks, generating monthly revenue. This income is distributed as onchain yield in stablecoins.  

## Why It Matters  

- Starting with Nigeria, 90% of trucks are owned by small operators with little or no access to financing..  
- Vehicle loans attract 25–36% APR in traditional banks.  
- Crypto users are seeking asset-backed, real-world returns.  

AudaCity creates the connective tissue.

## Market Context
- Nigeria's logistics sector: $7–11B, 2.4–3.7% of GDP
- 90% of trucks are owned by individuals or microfleets
- 22M+ Nigerians own crypto (Chainalysis, 2024)
- 40%+ of Nigeria’s crypto inflows are stablecoins
- Global RWA market: $10T by 2030 (BCG)
- Institutional momentum: BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton entering tokenized asset space

AudaCity is building the RWA frontier for transport — an overlooked yet essential vertical in emerging markets.
