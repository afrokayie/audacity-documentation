# AudaCity Litepaper

## Democratizing Transport Asset Ownership Through Blockchain Tokenization

Thereâ€™s a glaring paradox at the heart of African logistics: on one side, millions of people and businesses rely on trucks to move goods daily. On the other hand, the people who operate these trucks, often small, undercapitalized entrepreneurs, canâ€™t access the financing they need to grow.

Meanwhile, crypto has matured, but DeFi yield is still largely untethered to the real world. Investors are ready for stable, transparent, asset-backed returns.

**AudaCity** sits at the intersection of these two realities. We enable people to co-own commercial trucks and earn real yield from their movement, all onchain.

---

## The Market Weâ€™re Entering

Nigeriaâ€™s transport and logistics sector contributes roughly 2.4%â€“3.7% of GDP, valued at ~$9 billion annually. Over 90% of the countryâ€™s trucks are owned by individuals or micro-fleet operators, most of whom lack access to financing.

Despite this, trucks are essential: over 90% of Nigeriaâ€™s freight moves by road (NBS).

Truck acquisition costs range from â‚¦40â€“80M ($30Kâ€“$60K), and financing is scarce or predatory, with bank rates climbing as high as 36% APR. This results in an underserved system running below capacity.

On the flip side: Nigeria is #2 globally in crypto adoption, with 22 million crypto users. More than 40% of inflows are stablecoins, as users seek yield, dollar exposure, and alternatives to traditional banking.

## What Weâ€™re Building

**AudaCity makes trucks investable.**

Just as Moove transformed Uberâ€™s supply-side by financing cars for drivers, weâ€™re building the financing layer for logistics platforms in emerging markets. By enabling truck acquisition at scale, we become the engine behind delivery, freight, and fleet growth, starting in Nigeria and scaling globally.

We tokenize commercial trucks and allow investors to purchase fractional ownership via blockchain. These trucks are then deployed into active duty with licensed logistics partners, starting with [Trucki.co](https://trucki.co), a company with $1.8M+ in revenue.

As trucks generate profit, monthly revenue is streamed back to token holders. Investors earn consistent onchain yield, operators gain access to vehicles, and the ecosystem compounds value.

---

## How It Works

- Each truck is tokenized and legally wrapped in an SPV.
- Investors buy into a pool, gaining exposure to a group of trucks.
- Profits from logistics activity are converted to stablecoins and distributed monthly.
- Tokens are composable across DeFi: they can be staked, collateralized, or traded.
- Yields vary by fleet utilization and uptime, but modeled returns show ~2.5% monthly, with platform risk mitigated by pooling across multiple trucks and operators.

---

## Token Model

- **Token Type**: ERC-20, tied to SPV-based truck pools  
- **Denominated In**: USDC  
- **Returns**: Monthly payouts from profit  
- **Use Cases**: Composable in DeFi protocols (lending, staking, collateral)  

---

## Governance and Future Utility

As AudaCity scales, governance will gradually shift to token holders. Key decisions such as:

- Truck pool onboarding and offboarding  
- Fee structure proposals  
- Insurance or risk buffer allocation  
- Reward program calibrations  

â€¦will move onchain. In time, `$AUDA` could evolve from a passive ownership token into a governing asset within a decentralized transport financing protocol.

## Token Economics

| Component           | Value       |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Base value          | $300,000    |
| Insurance reserve   | 5%          |
| Maintenance reserve | 15%         |
| Operational buffer  | 10%         |
| **Total value**     | $400,000    |
| Token supply        | 400,000     |
| Token price         | $1.00       |

## Our Business Model

AudaCity charges a **15% performance fee** on net profits from truck activity. We only earn when trucks move and generate revenue, aligning incentives between us, our operators, and our investors.

Our go-to-market strategy is partner-led. We're working with established logistics platforms like Trucki, which already operate in core routes and serve large enterprise clients.

This creates a tight flywheel:  
**partner demand â†’ AudaCity-financed trucks â†’ revenue-sharing â†’ yield for investors â†’ more capital â†’ more trucks**

**Example**: A truck generating $1,333 monthly profit returns about $1,133 to the pool. AudaCity earns $200.

## Why Itâ€™s Hard (But Worth Doing)

If tokenized trucks were easy, theyâ€™d already exist. Weâ€™re solving three hard problems at once:

1. **Credit access** for underbanked operators  
2. **Yield thatâ€™s real**, not speculative  
3. **Transparency** in opaque systems  

> Nigeriaâ€™s average bank loan APR for vehicles: 25â€“36%  
> Share of truck owners with no formal credit history: 70%+  
> Estimated unmet demand for logistics assets across West Africa: $2B+

## De-Risking the Model

We know real-world assets come with real-world risk. Thatâ€™s why we built around resilience:

- **Operational**: Diversified truck pools  
- **Partner Risk**: Onchain SLAs and revenue terms  
- **Technical**: Audited contracts, GPS & earnings tracking, multi-sig safes  
- **Regulatory**: SPV wrappers, local + offshore compliance from Day 1

## Tech Stack

- Built on **Plume Network**, optimized for RWA  
- Cross-chain compatible via **LayerZero**  
- Modular smart contracts: asset registry, yield splitting, wallet whitelisting  
- Real-time revenue sync from partner APIs

## Global Vision

Weâ€™re only starting in Nigeria.

Across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and other parts of Africa, logistics suffers from the same bottleneck: **asset financing**. Our model is replicable, modular, and cross-chain compatibleâ€”designed to plug into any market where trucks move goods but capital is scarce.

Itâ€™s infrastructure for financing the real economy. And itâ€™s part of something bigger.

## The Real-World Asset Supercycle

BlackRock. Franklin Templeton. JPMorgan. They've all entered the tokenization race. The RWA market is projected to reach **$10 trillion by 2030** (Boston Consulting Group).

While most players focus on bonds, treasuries, and real estate, **weâ€™re focused on trucks** â€” the overlooked, high-yield, operational workhorses of emerging markets.

As institutional interest moves onchain, AudaCity becomes the **high-yield frontier of tokenized infrastructure**.

## Roadmap

- **Q3 2025**: Tokenize & deploy first 10 trucks (Trucki)  
- **Q4 2025**: Launch DeFi integrations, scale to 50+ trucks  
- **2026**: Enable secondary markets, expand across West Africa  
- **2027+**: U.S. entry, build toward $100M tokenized logistics pool

## Letâ€™s Build This Together

Weâ€™re assembling a new onchain infrastructure layerâ€”where asset-backed yield thrives.  
Whether youâ€™re an investor, validator, protocol dev, or operatorâ€”we want to hear from you.
